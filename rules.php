				<p>
				Guildleader: Owato<br>
				Raidleaders: Ehrya & Ilovemusic<br><br>
				</p>
				<li><b>Be On Time!</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Be ready at least 5 minutes before raid start. This includes being ready in-game and online on <b>discord</b>.</li>
						<li>If you're unable to come on time, you will have to inform one of the raid leaders or officers prior to the raid.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Flasks & Food</b>
					<ul>
						<li>You need to bring food + flasks yourself for all of our raids. This applies to both “Raiders” and “Trial Raiders”.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Communication</b>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Speak up if you don’t understand tactics or if you think something should be done differently.</b></li>
						<li>Use <b>push-to-talk</b> if you have a lot of background noise, otherwise you will be muted.</li>
						<li>Only raidleaders and tanks talk during a boss encounter.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Loot & Addons</b>
					<ul>
						<li>We require that raiders have addons like DBM / Bigwigs / Exorsus etc. installed and updated.</li>
						<li>We require that raiders have RCLootCouncil so we can divide loot properly. No addon, no loot. (Must be full guildrun).</li>
						<li>If a BOE item drops during raid, it will count as if it had dropped from a boss. If no one needs the item, it will be sold on AH and the gold will go toward guild-repair.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Trial raiders</b>
					<ul>
						<li>“Trial Raiders” can only participate in Trial Runs which is every second monday.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
