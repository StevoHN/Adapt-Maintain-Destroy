# Adapt-Maintain-Destroy
Website for a guild run by some of my friends

The website contains information about the guild's achievements in raids as well as which roles were currently needed.
You're able to apply for membership in the guild, read the rules and see the current roles and guild members.

The siter is no longer in use, but can be seen at http://www.adaptmaintaindestroy.dk
